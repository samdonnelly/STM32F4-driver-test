# STM32F4 Driver Test 

Application test code written in C/C++ for the <a href="https://github.com/samdonnelly/STM32F4-driver-library">STM32F4-driver-library</a> and specific use cases that also run on the STM32F4. The default branch is a template for creating new projects using this platform. 

## Library Tests 

Test code is written for the STM32F4 library drivers which focuses on showing how to use each driver as opposed to applying it to a specific application.

## Use Case Tests 

Application specific test code that focuses on use cases for the STM32F4 controller and driver library.

## Configurations 

Files used for configuring a device or storing information specific to a situation. These are used by the test code as needed.

## Generated Code 

This project was initially generated by STM32CubeMX for the STM32F4. As the repository has grown, it has shifted away from using this software to make changes to the project. The generated files can be found in the following folders.
