# STM32F4 Device Driver Test 

This repo is used to test device drivers used in the STM32F4 dev board in STM32F4-driver-library.
<br />

The 'template' branch is an empty code template from which to start a new device driver test. 
New branches should be created from here. Branches don't get merged back into 'template' once 
the driver test is complete. <br />

Device drivers are located in the STM32F4-driver-library repository. This allows easy access to
drivers by any project while keeping this repository strictly for testing. <br />
